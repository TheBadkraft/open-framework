## string ##

*Update*: removing the object as a structure. It was a useful tool to teach and re-introduce the ***C*** paradigm.  

After using *`string`* in several follow up libraries, I've come to the conclusing that `string` is kind of useless. I emjoyed the implementation but it seems overly verbose for **C**.  

I will do two things, however:
- implement a `typdef char* string` (*because I do think it's more relatable*)
- keep the `String` API.
