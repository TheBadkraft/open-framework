# OpenFramework
## The OpenPlatform Initiative

 **OpenPlatform** is about a return to grassroots software engineering. The mission is to return to basics: take what we've learned and re=invent our tools, our methods, and our protocols - rethink, re-engineer, and re-envision.

 C and Assembly (ASM) are extremely powerful. We should be looking to those powerhouse languages to re-imagine software engineering. OpenFramework will do just that.

 # Procedures
 I've been all over the internet looking for a few things.

 1. GCC linking
 2. Shared libraries
 3. ...

 # Tooling
 1. VS Code
 2. GCC

 Aside from some miscellaneous configuration formats, that's it.

 ## Operating Systems / Platforms
 1. Linux
 2. ...

 For now, the OpenPlatform Initiative is focused on Linux.

 Why Linux? Simplicity. Windows is invasive and Microsoft does not align with the core values of the Initiative. Neither does Apple, so that devalues macOS/OSX. In addition, Linux is a community platform. Neither Windows nor macOS are community driven. OpenPlatform, thus the OpenFramework is intended to be every bit *Community Driven* as Linux.

 OpenFramework will develop tools to simplify the processes for developing OP-*compliant* modules, libraries, etc. Coming from the **.Net/C#** world, one gets acquainted with modularization. The use of ***DLLs*** (*Dynamically Linked Libraries*) is important when it comes to modularization. We don't want to go around copying source and header files to the point there are 2 dozen locations that need to be updated. Shared libraries will keep duplcate source files to a bare minimum. Learning how to created a shared library and then use that shared library is what's first on the agenda.

 All development is taken from VS Code and using the built-in terminal
