# OpenFramework
## OpenPlatform Specifications

### Introduction

The project structure is not much different than most. The specification values portability. As important to portability is *familiarity*. The idea is to bring together what we've learned from all areas and ensure disparities in system design do not create undue hardships across software platforms. We have myriads of tools available that take advantage of the disparities to ensure a tenured life cycle and job security. The *Specification's* focus, therefore, is building flexibility into our processes so that quality software is the focus, not job security.

All that said to say this: data structure notations - like JSON - will remain a staple in how we communicate, configure, pass information, etc. **KISS** - *K*eep *I*t *S*uper *S*imple is the phrase for the day. That means, if we have to learn a whole new language just to compile our source, we're doing it wrong. *CMake* and all over varieties of that will never be a part of building applications or linking *OP-Compliant* modules.
