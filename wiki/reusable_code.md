## OpenPlatform Specifications

### Section III

**Reusable Code (_Modular Development_)**

Using shared libraries (objects) is the key to modularized *components*.

On Linux, the specification expects the developer to be familiar and comfortable with accessing `usr/local/lib` and `usr/local/include`.

The *`usr/local/include`* directory, should resemble the logical structure of your *`project`*`/include` directory.
