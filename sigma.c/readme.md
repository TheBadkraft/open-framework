## Sigma.C ## 
What is **Sigma.C** (or, *Sig.C*)? A new derivative of C. The name may change to something else but I hope it retains the `C` moniker.  

The goal is that most C will compile under *Sig.C*. We wil be extending the features allowing some "work" to be done under the hood.  

There are 4 goals with the simple main program. Each of the following are valid:  
1. `int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { ... }`
2. `int main(int argc, char **argv) { ... }`
3. `int main(void) { ... }`
4. `int main() {... }`

It is also worth noting that `return 0` is not necessary.  

Furthermore, testing `main` entry with variadic parameters: `int main(int argc, ...) { ... }`  
GCC does compile this adding about 15 lines of source to the resulting ASM.  

Right off, I think we need to be able to call C functions from *Sig.C*. Knowing what that looks like from ASM is not difficult.  

The *Sig.C* specification will provide for all 5 of the accepted entry points in addition to a method-less approach:

``` c#
//  main.ct

printf("Welcom to Sig.C\n");
```

This brings into question how we access command parameters. Before we do that, however, let's resolved iterating over variadic parameters.  
One of the goals with *Sig.C* is to reduce dependency on `#define` as a mechnanism to generate code. Aside from the fragility of `#define`, it is error-prone, ugly, and hides a lot from the reader.  

Variadic iteratation depends on telling the compiler the last arg prior to the `...` (ellipses). Then the compiler gets to do some fumbly stuff depending on ... once again, `#define`d source and some *`__built_in`* goodies.  

We ought to have an iterator mechanism. Let's use a `keyword` to let the compiler know what we're doing. We can also, then, provide proper iterator functionality.  

An `Iterator` mechanism then brings us to understand how collections work and, therefore, how an *iterator* traverses the collection, knowing when it is done.  

First, however, let's accomplish 2 goals:
1. generate source **as** source (ASM) from *Sig.C* (*method-less* `main.ct`)
2. include (import ...???) C function `printf`

A note about *Sigma.C* source/header file extensions: source file extensiions will use an uppercase '**.C**' and header files will have use an uppercase '**.H**'.

## ASM ##
What does the `as` look like?
A bare-bones ASM file is as follows:
``` c#
.global	_start

.text
_start:
	movl  $1, %eax   # 1 ("exit") -> EAX
	movl  $0, %ebx   # 0 (with success) -> EBX
	int   $0x80      # see previous
.data
```

This theoretically renders as:
``` c
// basic, bare-bones executable
int main() {
}
```

What does the equivalent GCC .s source look like?
``` c#
	.file	"main.c"
	.text
	.globl	main
	.type	main, @function
main:
.LFB0:
	.cfi_startproc
	endbr64
	pushq	%rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
	.cfi_offset 6, -16
	movq	%rsp, %rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa_register 6
	movl	$0, %eax
	popq	%rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa 7, 8
	ret
	.cfi_endproc
.LFE0:
	.size	main, .-main
	.ident	"GCC: (Ubuntu 12.3.0-1ubuntu1~23.04) 12.3.0"
	.section	.note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
	.section	.note.gnu.property,"a"
	.align 8
	.long	1f - 0f
	.long	4f - 1f
	.long	5
0:
	.string	"GNU"
1:
	.align 8
	.long	0xc0000002
	.long	3f - 2f
2:
	.long	0x3
3:
	.align 8
4:
```

*NOTE: I would like to keep comments in the structure. This can help track comments like place holders and know where the code is.*  

Lastly, unless there needs to be some reason to add the `.` directives that GCC employs, we are going to try and stick to forming correct **as** ASM. It is part of the GCC tool chain so we should be able to find all the necessary documentation to make this work.

What are we going to write the *Sigma.C* toolchain in? That is, the parsers, pre-processors, etc, etc.? I am looking at a hybrid approach. I think it is extremely noble that *FASM* is written in assembly. But, I'm partial to letting the bits that have already been developed to do certain tasks be put to use. I don't have a particular inclination to introduce any C++. So, we will use a combination of ASM & C ... maybe, eventually, *Sigma.C* will take the place of C. For now, though, I think C is perfectly suited for the task at hand.

What are our expectations? Well, let's jump right in and see what I envision for *Sigma.C*.  

Let's assume what we want is the following:
``` c#
.global	_start

.text
_start:
	movl  $4, %eax   # 4 (code for "write" syscall) -> EAX register
	movl  $1, %ebx   # 1 (file descriptor for stdout) -> EBX (1st argument to syscall)
	movl  $msg, %ecx # 32-bit address of msg string -> ECX (2nd argument)
	movl  $len, %edx # length of msg string -> EDX (3rd arg)
	int   $0x80      # interrupt with location 0x80 (128), which invokes the kernel's system call procedure

	movl  $1, %eax   # 1 ("exit") -> EAX
	movl  $0, %ebx   # 0 (with success) -> EBX
	int   $0x80      # see previous
.data
msg:
	.ascii  "Welcome to Sigma.C!\n"  # inline ascii string
	len =   . - msg           	 # assign (current address - address of msg start) to symbol "len"
``` 
Given the above assembly from our intermediate compilation, we might expect:
``` c#
//	file: main.ct

//  include syntax is similar; simplified grammaticals
#include io.h;

//  standard return data type
int main () {
    //  standard modernized output syntax
    writef("Welcome to Sigma.C\n");

    //  return value is not implicitly required
}
```

Why keep the *`#include *.h;`* syntax? 
Options ... C# doesn't require a *header* file because it generates symbol files. We could have symbol files generated as *Sig.C* matures. Then we have a hybrid approach. Symbol files are a partially compiled format where headers are fully legible. There are advantages to both and likely may have reasons that both make sense. My initial approach at this point (because I don't have any compiled source or header files) is to create something of a symbol file. Might look something like this:

``` c#
!# sigma.c(asm)

void writef(len, msg) {
    movl  $4, %eax   // 4 (code for "write" syscall) -> EAX register
	movl  $1, %ebx   // 1 (file descriptor for stdout) -> EBX (1st argument to syscall)
	movl  $msg, %ecx // 32-bit address of msg string -> ECX (2nd argument)
	movl  $len, %edx // length of msg string -> EDX (3rd arg)
	int   $0x80      // interrupt with location 0x80 (128), which invokes the kernel's system call procedure
}
```

That's it ... simple.
So, now we just need a ~~parser~~ *Lexer*, right? Okay. But that's just the beginning ...

## ~~Parsing~~ Lexing ##
We are going to start small. We want to understand what we are doing. I found a great article by [Nora Sandler][1] that seems like it will get things going in the right direction. I also looked at how we might write our own custom front end for GCC. Both of these are viable options; indeed, both will likely be the intention. With a custom compiler we are going to be able to know exactly what we want from a GCC front end.

Without further ado ...

**NOTE: Nora is using AT&T _assembly syntax_. We will be using GCC's AS syntax.**

Nora writes a simple *C* `main` method:

``` c
int main() {
    return 2;
}
```

This will be our first task - to parse our *Sigma.C* `main` method. At this point, we look identical.

We need 3 things:
1. Codex -- provides information about how we build our language
2. Lexer -- tokenizes source code
3. Parser -- parses tokens

We are going to start simple. The *Codex* contains **_glyphs_** and **_terms_**.

**Glyphs**
- letters
- digits
- symbols

**Terms**
- keywords
- ~~data types~~	*(removed - data types are general keywords)*
- ~~decorators~~	*(replaced with **paired**)*
- paired
- matched
- identifiers
- operators
- terminals
- etc (TBD)

Nora suggests using *regex* to parse. I'm not too keen (*personally*) on regex. I will take a kind of Backus-Naur approach. Regardless, Here is what we need to identify:

_identifier_:
 **main**

~~_decorators_~~ _paired_:
 **()**
 **{}**

_keyword_:
 **int**
 **return**

_value_:
 **2**

_terminal_:
 **;**

As of 8/8/2024 ... 
*Lexer* is performing basic functions:
1. *naive* tokenization - with a naive set of rules, the *Lexer* creates a linked list of tokens  
2. basic term recognition - determines **keyword**, **paired**, etc.  
3. counts all paired symbols to ensure each is closed  

Ensuring paired closures - that is `(..)`, `{..}`, and `[..]` - is also naive from the perspective of the *Lexer*. Counting paired closures will not look at syntax, grammar, etc. That will be the job of the *Parser* to ensure proper use and syntax.  

To this end, the mechanism is like a register. One register for each `(`, `{`, and `[`. For every `(`, `{`, or `[`, the respective register increments; for every `)`, `}`, or `]`, the register decrements. After tokenization, the *Parser* will review the statistics and ensure it is okay to proceed.  

In my previous attempts to develop a compiler, I had not built a *Lexer* per se. I was putting all the work into the *Parser* with an *Analyzer* component. Effectively, the results were a set of tokens and some sort of understanding of the syntax. Using `C#` I had a great parser using a form of *Backus-Naur* that I modified to work better with consuming and creating delegates and expressions. Nora goes into *Backus-Naur* as well. As my understanding of *Backus-Naur* improves, we will likely integrate more of the form into the *Lexer*.  

## Expressions ## 
Expressions are how we put it all together. The *Parser* is the component responsible for putting all the expressions together. While Nora's project is helpful, it is written entirely in Python. We are writing in *C* ... and while I do have experience in some older Python, she is far more advanced than I and making sense of some of it is not easy. So, I've begun tooling around the inter-webz looking for more learning with *C*. And, I think I found some really helpful bits.  

In order to build *Abstract Syntax Trees **(AST)***, a robust mechanism for describing and building *Expression Trees* is extremely important. [Leonidas Fegaras][2] produced a good resource on compilers while at the University of Texas, Arlington. No doubt, I'll be digging into his writing more. For now, though, let's look at what we need for our first expression tree object.

Let's define several non-terminals that fit our basic requirement to compile this:  
``` c
int main() {
    return 2;
}
```
A couple of thoughts right off the bat are the following:
**<program_expr>**
**<function_expr>**
**<return_expr>**
**<literal_expr>**

> NOTE: A **literal_expr** can have 2 general variations - *string* or *numeric*. 
> - *string* literal includes ***char***; 
> - *numeric* literal includes any numeric type - ***byte***, ***int***, ***float***, etc.

Now we can come up with what the *Backus-Naur* Form will be. I'll draw from another well-established document - [C99, Annex A][3] is an excellent source.
